                    <p>
                        Our journey is something that sets us apart — from a small finance company founded in South Africa in 2008 to an international organisation with listings on the London and Johannesburg Stock Exchanges. Discover how our history of organic growth and strategic acquisitions lets us offer clients both local expertise and a global perspective, and uniquely combines modern thinking and nimbleness, with tradition and trust. If you have questions or comments, please don’t hesitate to contact us.
                    </p>

                    <p>Sincerely,

                    <strong>David Smith</strong>
